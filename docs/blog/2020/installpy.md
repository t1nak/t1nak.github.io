 
# Installing python on Mac with Anaconda 


Go to [https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/mac-os/)  and use the standard installer. Yes it's big, but it's the easiest and smoothest way for a beginner.

    <ul> Tip:
        <li> Always know  where your python executable is (<b>which python</b> in terminal) and configure your PATH! </li>
        <li><b> I would not recommend beginner to install python with Homebrew </b> 
        --> <b>brew cask install anaconda</b> will want to install the python distribution in<b> /usr/local </b>but  conda was designed to be installed in <b>$HOME</b> --> this could lead to unpredictable behaviour!  </li>
