I'm an Econ PhD graduate from University of Cape Town with an interest in Computational Economics. 
I'm passionate about integrating data science methods into academic science and teaching.                                                                                                         I'm particularly fond of python due to its versatility and easy, beautiful syntax. 
Maybe I can convince you to learn python [here](python.md). ðŸ¤—
